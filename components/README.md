# Components Directory

This directory will contain all React components organized by feature:

- `ui/` - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form components for gas safety records, invoices, and checklists
- `auth/` - Authentication related components
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, sidebar, etc.)

Components will be implemented in subsequent tasks.
